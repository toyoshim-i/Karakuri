//! The console, drawn: every region in its place, with its heading, and
//! nothing inside.
//!
//! This is the half of the crate that knows a toolkit. It reads the solved
//! rectangles out of [`Panel`] and paints them with `egui`; it holds no fact
//! about the arrangement and answers no question [`karakuri_layout::Layout`]
//! can answer.
//!
//! # What is here, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! **Every leaf of the arrangement gets its region, and seven of them get a
//! bay head.** Nothing else. A bay's body is empty and looks it — no
//! placeholder rows, no sample values, no greyed-out control that hints at
//! what will be there. Scaffolding that looks finished does not get replaced,
//! and the next person to open the panel should be in no doubt about what
//! exists.
//!
//! **One body is not empty, and it is not an exception to that.** The Program
//! bay's picture is a [`Kind::Picture`], and what it draws is a texture handed
//! in from outside — real texels off a real device, not a mock-up of some. It
//! draws nothing at all when there is no texture, exactly as every other empty
//! body does. See [`Picture`] and [`picture_rect`].
//!
//! # The deck previews are the one thing drawn with nothing behind it
//!
//! [`Kind::Previews`] paints four cells whether or not a deck is running in
//! any of them, and that is **not** the scaffolding the paragraph above
//! forbids. A greyed-out control is a placeholder for a control that does not
//! exist yet; a preview cell is not a placeholder for anything, it is the
//! region's own face. The mock's `.preview` is a well with a letter in it
//! before it is a picture — three of its four cells hold no texels at all —
//! and the Program bay's head reads *previews 2 of 4*, which is an operator's
//! ordinary choice and not a state waiting to be finished. **An empty cell is
//! what off looks like, not a stand-in for a full one**, and the label says
//! so: `A` where there is a picture and `C · off` where there is not.
//!
//! So the two rules are one rule. Nothing is drawn that claims something
//! exists which does not; a cell that is off exists and says it is off.
//! See [`DECKS`], [`preview_rects`] and [`View::previews`], and
//! [ADR-0170](../../../docs/adr/0170-a-deck-preview-cell-is-drawn-whether-or-not-a-deck-is-behind-it.md)
//! for the alternative that lost and for what would reopen it.
//!
//! The transport and the outputs are **rows, not bays**: they carry no
//! heading, because they have none in the mock — both carry `class="bay"`,
//! which is the card styling, and neither carries a `.bay-head`
//! ([ADR-0159](../../../docs/adr/0159-the-consoles-words-are-the-manuals-and-the-middle-one-is-not-a-pane.md)).
//!
//! # The transport row is four readouts and no controls at all
//!
//! [`Kind::Transport`] draws the tempo, the beat grid, the bar and the frame
//! readout — **the four things in the mock's row that are a value somebody
//! measured rather than a control over something that does not exist.** The
//! other six are named in [`transport`], one by one, with what is missing
//! behind each; the paragraph above is the whole of the argument and this row
//! is where it costs the most, because six of the mock's ten items go.
//!
//! What it draws with no engine behind it is **nothing at all** — not a row of
//! zeroes and not a row of dashes, either of which is a reading invented for a
//! console that has none. That is [`View::picture`]'s rule, and the values
//! arrive the same way it does: a plain [`Transport`] written per frame by
//! whoever owns the engine, because `src/` takes no device, no window and no
//! clock (ADR-0156) and this row is made of a clock and an engine.
//!
//! # The Outputs row has one control in it, and it is the console's first
//!
//! [`Kind::Outputs`] draws the word OUTPUTS and **one** `.sink` — the picture,
//! which the manual lists as *program view*. Everything else in the mock's row
//! is a control over something that does not exist, and [`outputs`] names each
//! of them and says why it is not drawn. The dot is lit from
//! [`Layout::visible`] on the picture's node and a press on it asks for
//! [`Op::Fold`] or [`Op::Unfold`] by name, so the control and the keyboard
//! reach one operation between them rather than two states that agree until
//! they do not.
//!
//! It is also the first thing on the panel a press has to *reach*, which is
//! the rule [`crate::input`] was written for and the clearance
//! `tests/outputs.rs` holds.
//!
//! # The Mixer bay is the first bay with something in its body
//!
//! [`Kind::Mixer`] draws the card and the head every other bay gets, and then
//! **as many strips as the deck has** — not four. `Deck::slot_count` is what
//! there is, and a page of this bay has [`DECKS`] tracks whatever that number
//! is, so a track with no strip in it draws nothing at all rather than an
//! empty strip. **That is not the deck previews' rule read backwards.** A
//! preview cell is the region's own face and says `off`; a strip is six
//! readings, and an empty one is six readings nobody took — the row of zeroes
//! ADR-0177 refuses, with a different glyph. See [`mixer`] and [`Strip`], and
//! [`Meter`] for why a meter is not a [`Fader`].
//!
//! **Everything in that bay is a readout**, and the source says so rather than
//! leaving the next reader to discover it: the trim, the fader, the tally and
//! the two minis are drawn from what the deck says, and a press on any of them
//! reaches nothing. Dragging a fader is a second kind of drag — the value
//! belongs to the engine rather than to the arrangement — and it needs an
//! operation named once for the four surfaces and a decision about the claim
//! model. That is its own pass.
//!
//! # The bay head is one component with seven call sites
//!
//! [`bay_head`] is written once and seven bays call it: six through
//! [`Kind::Bay`] in [`REGIONS`] and the mixer through [`Kind::Mixer`], which
//! is a bay whose body is not empty. That is this repository's rule about an
//! abstraction needing two call sites, satisfied on the day it is written
//! rather than promised for later — and so is [`fader`], which is written once
//! and drawn twice in every strip.
//!
//! # `.console`'s own 10px of padding is not drawn
//!
//! The mock's console is a card with `padding: 10px`, so the ground shows in a
//! ring around the outermost bays as well as in every divider. The
//! arrangement's root fills the viewport it is given and
//! [`Panel::set_viewport`] puts that viewport at the origin, so the ring would
//! have to be an offset applied to every rectangle on the way out and undone
//! on every pointer coordinate on the way in — a second coordinate space, for
//! ten pixels of margin. The window's edge is the panel's edge here, and the
//! ground shows in the dividers alone.

/// `.program-body`'s `gap: 8px`, which is the split's divider and belongs to
/// neither child, and the 9 further down is that body's bottom padding, which
/// belongs to `deck-previews`. So the only 9s in this region are the one above
/// the picture and the one either side of it.
///
/// At the narrowest console the mock will draw, that box is exactly
/// **466 x 262** — and 466 x 262 is 16:9 *to a quarter of a pixel* rather than
/// exactly. `.program-view` carries `aspect-ratio: 16/9`, so 466 wide is
/// **262.125** tall, and the arrangement transcribed the whole pixel the mock
/// rasterises it at. The box is therefore 1.778626 where the canvas is
/// 1.7777778, which is the whole of why the paragraph below exists.
///
/// # The rectangle is a whole number of pixels, and that is about resampling
///
/// A strict fit into that box gives 465.7778 x 262. **A caller's `physical`
/// rounds to whole texels, so the texture it then allocates is 466 wide** —
/// and the picture would be a 466-texel texture drawn into a 465.7778-wide
/// box, where every texel on screen is a fractional sample of its neighbours
/// instead of a blit. Of every region on this panel that is worst here: the
/// picture is a *preview of what is being captured*, and softening it is the
/// one thing it may not do. It also buys nothing — the texture's own ratio is
/// 466:262 either way, because `physical` rounded. **The fractional quarter
/// pixel is not more faithful to 16:9; it is the same texture, softened.**
///
/// Two smaller reasons, and they are second. Every number in this console is a
/// whole logical pixel because the mock is authored in whole ones —
/// [`preview_cells`] comes out 112 x 63 with no rounding at all because 466
/// happens to divide, not because a cell is exempt from this. And a box whose
/// extent is whole is a box the picture's edge lands on the pixel grid in,
/// which is what `.program-view`'s own hard-edged well is drawn as.
///
/// **What it costs, plainly:** the picture's ratio is then the mock's 1.778626
/// rather than exactly the canvas's. `Present::draw` is what absorbs the
/// difference and that is why it stays — see [`WHOLE_TEXTURE`]. Snapping does
/// not make the engine's letterbox redundant; it makes it sub-texel.
///
/// # The leftover is the console's ground, and a capture pays for it
///
/// Above the mock's narrowest the region is wider than the picture, and what
/// is beside the picture is the Program bay's card with nothing drawn on it.

///   and nothing here opens an input or installs one — a `Deck` with nobody
///   calling `set_audio` runs on a synthesized bus, and an armed pill would
///   say the room is being listened to while it is not.
/// - `tap` is tap tempo: a performer's taps timed and turned into a tempo
///   correction. Nothing times a tap here, and the pill would correct nothing.
/// - `learn` is MIDI learn, and its own tooltip says what it would do —
///   *"Click, then point at any control and move a knob on your surface, and
///   the two are mapped."* There is no map, no learn mode, and exactly one
///   control on the panel to point at.
/// - `map · nanoKONTROL2 ▾` is the map in use, *and it is a file*. None is
///   loaded, saved or recalled anywhere here, and a menu naming a device
///   nobody has plugged in is worse than no menu.
/// - `landed` is what the last write did — *landed, rolled back for cost, or
///   failed to build*. That is a build watcher's verdict over a hot swap, and
///   nothing writes a procedure while this panel runs, so the pill would be
///   reporting on a write that never happens.

///   it.
///

/// - **The head's `4 of 4 · page 1`.** *"The strip is a paged list whose
///   length is a number, and the header says which page you are on"* — so both
///   halves of that pill are about paging, and there is none. Every strip the
///   deck has is drawn, on the one page, so the pill could only ever read
///   `n of n · page 1`: two numbers that are always equal and a third that is
///   always 1. That is [`Kind::Bay`]'s own rule about a pill stating a value
///   the console does not have, and the number that *is* known — how many
///   strips there are — is on the face of the bay already. It arrives with
///   paging.
/// - **`.xfade`, the whole crossfade row under the strips**: an A/B track with
///   a handle on it, and `wipe`, `iris`, `next bar`, `8 beats` and `go`. That
///   is a transition being armed and then fired, and every one of them is a
///   control over machinery the console cannot reach — nothing here holds what
///   is armed, and `go` would fire nothing. It is 61 of the bay's 316 and it
///   stays empty, exactly as six of the transport row's ten items do.
/// - **`.strip.focus` and `.wfocus`, which are the two focuses**: the deck
///   selection, which persists and is what a key press is addressed to, and
///   keyboard focus, which is transient. The mock draws them differently on
///   purpose — a solid lavender ring and a dashed sun outline — because
///   *"drawing them the same erases which of the two a reader is looking at"*.
///   **Neither exists in this console**: nothing here selects a deck and
///   nothing takes keyboard focus, so a ring would be drawn around a state
///   that is not kept.
/// - **Every tooltip.** Four of this bay's controls carry one, and a tooltip
///   needs `egui` to own a widget — the sentence [`outputs`] writes about a
///   control, one bay along.
///
/// `layout` must be solved: [`Layout::rect`] refuses to answer from a dirty
/// one. `ctx` is asked for the type, because the tally's capsule and the
/// blend's mini are as wide as the words in them.

/// Painted the same whether a deck is running in it or not, because *off* is a
/// state an operator chooses rather than a thing not built yet — the module
/// documentation is where that argument is written out.
///
/// Term for term from `.preview` in `style.css`:
///
/// - `background: var(--c-well)` — `pal.well`, and it is the ground the
///   texture is drawn over rather than a fallback for one, so a texture with
///   any transparency in it reads as a recess and not as a hole.
/// - `border-radius: 7px` — [`size::PREVIEW_RADIUS`].
/// - `box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px var(--c-hair)` — a 1px stroke on the
///   **inside** of the box in `pal.hair`, drawn last so it sits over the
///   texture exactly as an inset shadow sits over a background image.
/// - `display: flex; align-items: flex-end; padding: 3px 5px;
///   font-size: 9px` — the letter in the bottom-left corner, inside that
///   padding, at [`size::PREVIEW_SIZE`].
///
/// # The two colours the label takes, and what each is standing for
///
/// - **A picture behind it:** `.preview.a` and `.preview.b` set
///   `color: rgba(255,255,255,0.7)`, which is white because the mock's cell is
///   always a dark gradient. The console's cell holds real texels of unknown
///   brightness in either room, and there is no *white at 70%* in the palette
///   — so this is `pal.text`, `--c-text`, the mock's own colour for a value.
///   It follows the room, which is the one thing the mock's literal white
///   cannot do.
/// - **Nothing behind it:** `.preview`'s own `color: var(--c-faint)`, which is
///   `pal.faint` — *"a heading, and anything switched off"*, and this cell is
///   switched off.
///
/// And the word follows the colour: the mock writes `C &middot; off` in a cell
/// with nothing in it, so a cell that is off says `off` rather than leaving
