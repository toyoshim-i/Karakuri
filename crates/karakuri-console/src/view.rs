//! The console, drawn: every region in its place, with its heading, and
//! nothing inside.
//!
//! This is the half of the crate that knows a toolkit. It reads the solved
//! rectangles out of [`Panel`] and paints them with `egui`; it holds no fact
//! about the arrangement and answers no question [`karakuri_layout::Layout`]
//! can answer.
//!
//! # What is here, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! **Every leaf of the arrangement gets its region, and seven of them get a
//! bay head.** Nothing else. A bay's body is empty and looks it — no
//! placeholder rows, no sample values, no greyed-out control that hints at
//! what will be there. Scaffolding that looks finished does not get replaced,
//! and the next person to open the panel should be in no doubt about what
//! exists.
//!
//! The transport and the outputs are **rows, not bays**: they carry no
//! heading, because they have none in the mock — both carry `class="bay"`,
//! which is the card styling, and neither carries a `.bay-head`
//! ([ADR-0159](../../../docs/adr/0159-the-consoles-words-are-the-manuals-and-the-middle-one-is-not-a-pane.md)).
//!
//! # The bay head is one component with seven call sites
//!
//! [`bay_head`] is written once and [`REGIONS`] calls it seven times, which is
//! this repository's rule about an abstraction needing two call sites,
//! satisfied on the day it is written rather than promised for later.
//!
//! # `.console`'s own 10px of padding is not drawn
//!
//! The mock's console is a card with `padding: 10px`, so the ground shows in a
//! ring around the outermost bays as well as in every divider. The
//! arrangement's root fills the viewport it is given and
//! [`Panel::set_viewport`] puts that viewport at the origin, so the ring would
//! have to be an offset applied to every rectangle on the way out and undone
//! on every pointer coordinate on the way in — a second coordinate space, for
//! ten pixels of margin. The window's edge is the panel's edge here, and the
//! ground shows in the dividers alone.
