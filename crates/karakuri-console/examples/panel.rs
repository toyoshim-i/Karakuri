//! The console, drawn: every region in its place, with its heading, and
//! nothing inside.
//!
//! **One window loop, not two.** This replaces `examples/layout.rs`, which
//! painted every region as a flat rectangle and drew no text at all — a
//! harness written to answer *does a divider drag* before there was a toolkit
//! to answer it with. `egui` supersedes the painter, and keeping both would
//! have meant two window loops disagreeing about who owns the pointer.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run -p karakuri-console --example panel
//! cargo test -p karakuri-console                   # the model and the view
//! cargo test -p karakuri-console --example panel   # this file's own tests
//! ```
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! Three things, and none of them is a bay.
//!
//! 1. That `egui` renders through `wgpu` 30 into this window at all, which is
//!    the bet
//!    [ADR-0155](../../../docs/adr/0155-egui-draws-the-panel-and-the-price-is-wgpu-30.md)
//!    made.
//! 2. That the arrangement's numbers look right at real sizes against
//!    `docs/manual/console.html`.
//! 3. That dragging a boundary still works with a toolkit in the loop.
//!
//! **It is deliberately not the start of a bay.** Every body is empty; see
//! [`karakuri_console::view`].
//!
//! # This file owns none of the model, and none of the view
//!
//! The arrangement, the drag, the operations, the palette, the bay head and
//! the rule about who gets a pointer event are all `karakuri-console`. What is
//! left here is a window, a surface, the `egui` plumbing between them, and the
//! English — a `Dragged` into the line it prints, an `Outcome` into the line a
//! key prints. **The model returns what happened; the words are this file's.**
//!
//! # The readout is driven by the layout, not by the pointer
//!
//! A line is printed when the boundary **moves**, and a stop is announced
//! once. That is `Panel::moved`'s doing rather than this file's: it returns
//! nothing at all for a move that changed nothing. A line per pointer event is
//! one comparison less and wrong twice over — the interesting lines are buried
//! under identical ones, and a hand held against the edge of the window, which
//! is where a drag ends up, produces hundreds a second into a terminal that
//! has to keep up with them while the window waits.
//!
//! # Every frame that could not be acquired gets a decision
//!
//! This loop waits for events rather than spinning, so nothing asks for
//! another frame on its own. A `get_current_texture` that comes back
//! `Outdated` and is dropped with a bare `return` is therefore a window that
//! stops drawing and never starts again, with nothing said anywhere — see
//! [`missed`], carried over from the example this replaces, and
//! `karakuri-cli`'s window sink, which carries the same table after the same
//! failure.
//!
//! # A panic here aborts the process
//!
//! macOS cannot unwind a Rust panic across the Objective-C frame a `winit`
//! callback is called from, so an assertion reachable from an event handler is
//! a crash and not an error. Nothing below asserts on input.
